The CVS version of SDLRoads uses Unix packages of the SDL Libraries to compile.
As such, if you would like to compile the CVS version of SDLRoads, the easiest
way to do so is to use Fink (or possibly Darwinports) to install the following
libraries:

SDL
SDL_mixer
SDL_image
SDL_ttf

This can be accomplished via the following:

  sudo apt-get install sdl sdl-mixer sdl-image sdl-ttf \
                       sdl-mixer-shlibs sdl-image-shlibs sdl-ttf-shlibs

Once you have done this, you can download the SDLRoads code from CVS:
export CVSROOT=":pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/sdlroads"
cvs co sdlroads

This will create an "sdlroads" directory.

Typically, you could then use ./autogen.sh to compile. However, because you
will be using an Apple framework to provide access to the OpenGL calls, you 
will need to make a few small changes.

Remove the following lines from configure.ac:
dnl Checks for libraries.
AC_CHECK_LIB([GL], [glBegin],, AC_MSG_ERROR([Error! You do not have OpenGL
installed. You will not be able to play this game.]))
AC_CHECK_LIB([GLU], [gluLookAt],, AC_MSG_ERROR([Error! You do not have OpenGL
installed. You will not be able to play this game.]))

These lines are unneccesary - they check for the OpenGL Framework, which is
installed by default on OS X.

Then run the following commands:

aclocal
autoconf
autoheader
automake
export LIBS="`sdl-config --libs`"
./configure
make

Then, become root, and
make install

Lastly, type sdlroads, and all should be well.

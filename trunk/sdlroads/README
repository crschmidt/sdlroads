################################################################################

This project is designed to be an OpenGL clone of a DOS game circa 1993. 
(Information about the original Skyroads is available at 
http://www.bluemoon.ee/history/skyroads/.)

As a matter of fact, this game is distributed with the original skyroads
tracks.  (Thanks, Soup!)  To use these tracks run sdlroads with the command line
arguments, '-t tracks/skyroads'.  We haven't implemented tunnels yet, and at the
time these tracks were converted, not all the colors from the original game were
supported.

================================================================================

Release notes (BUGS):

- Windows users: No guarantees that switching out of fullscreen will leave the
  game in the visible region on the screen.  Try looking a few hundred pixels
  below the taskbar ;-)

- I know of 1 bug in the collision detection code.  It's uncommon, but if your
  ship hits the edge of the track near a concave corner (from the outside),
  the ship could hit.

================================================================================

System Requirements:

- Hardware-acclerated OpenGL
- SDL
- SDL_mixer
- SDL_ttf
- SDL_image (with jpeglib)

- Up,Down: 		Accelerate/Decelerate
- Space: 		jump
- r: 			restart the map
- f:			toggle fullscreen
- p: 			pause
- q:			quit
- Escape:		menu

Menu Controls:

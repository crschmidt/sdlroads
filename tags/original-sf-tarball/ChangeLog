2005-01-23  Peter Newman  <panewman@uiuc.edu>

	* src/menu.c, src/settings.c, src/sound.c:
	so it turns out music was broken...  fade-ins and fade-outs added too

	* src/main.c: frame limiter improved even more

	* src/input.c, src/game.c: track works, but the input is sticky

	* src/core.h, src/game.c, src/game.h, src/input.c, src/main.c, src/menu.c, src/menu.h, src/consts.h:
	implemented key-throttling for menu.  doesn't seem to work yet

	* src/input.c, src/input.h, src/main.c, src/menu.c, src/menu.h, src/game.c:
	the menu "works" now (key input is kind of fast now)

	* src/main.c, src/menu.c, src/model.c, src/model.h, src/settings.c, src/ship.c, src/sound.c, src/text.c, src/track.c, src/util.c, src/util.h, src/window.c, src/window.h, src/core.h, src/defs.h, src/game.c, src/input.c:
	at least it compiles now

	* src/menu.c, src/track.c: a few bits of progress

	* src/Makefile.am, src/camera.c, src/consts.h, src/core.h, src/defs.h, src/game.c, src/game.h, src/images.c, src/images.h, src/input.c, src/input.h, src/main.c, src/model.c, src/render.c, src/render.h, src/scene.c, src/scene.h, src/settings.c, src/window.c:

	working, checkout sources from the alpha-src branch

2005-01-12  Peter Newman  <panewman@uiuc.edu>

	* src/consts-falcon.h, src/menu.c, src/scene.c, src/scene.h, src/ship.c, src/window.c:

	inconsequential changes made during downtime

2005-01-03  Peter Newman  <panewman@uiuc.edu>

	* src/main.c, src/menu.c:
	wrote a check for ensuring that a level is loaded before the user
	ESCapes out of the menu

	* src/defs.h, src/settings.c, src/track.c, src/args.c:
	now accepts alternate track paths, though only from paths relative to
	the datadir (and ending in a /)

2005-01-02  Peter Newman  <panewman@uiuc.edu>

	* TODO: less TODO...

	* src/track.c:
	added a check for requests of color indices already in use by the
	builtin colors

	* TODO: ok, the colors can wait

	* TODO: marked a few items as being needed for the beta release

	* src/menu.c:
	menu wraps now; 2-column overflow menus touched up a bit

	* fonts/Makefile.am, fonts/drg.ttf:
	an interesting font i've been using; since I commited a text.c that uses
	it, I might as well put it in version control

	* src/scene.c, src/scene.h, src/settings.c, src/settings.h, src/ship.c, src/ship.h, src/sound.c, src/sound.h, src/text.c, src/text.h, src/track.c, src/track.h, src/util.c, src/util.h, src/window.c, src/window.h, src/args.c, src/args.h, src/camera.c, src/camera.h, src/consts-falcon.h, src/consts.h, src/core.h, src/defs.h, src/images.c, src/images.h, src/input.c, src/input.h, src/main.c, src/mathlib.c, src/mathlib.h, src/menu.c, src/menu.h, src/model.c, src/model.h, src/render.c, src/render.h:

	* ChangeLog, NEWS, README, TODO: administrivial stuff

	* src/settings.c, src/window.c:
	cutting some fat -- unnecessary logging in settings, code reduction on
	window

2004-12-25  Peter Newman  <panewman@uiuc.edu>

	* sound/darkness.ogg:
	this file is too huge to download on every checkout

	* tracks/skyroads/road1-1, tracks/skyroads/road1-2, tracks/skyroads/road1-3, tracks/skyroads/road2-1, tracks/skyroads/road2-2, tracks/skyroads/road2-3, tracks/skyroads/road3-1, tracks/skyroads/road3-2, tracks/skyroads/road3-3, tracks/skyroads/road4-1, tracks/skyroads/road4-2, tracks/skyroads/road4-3, tracks/skyroads/road5-1, tracks/skyroads/road5-2, tracks/skyroads/road5-3, tracks/skyroads/road6-1, tracks/skyroads/road6-2, tracks/skyroads/road6-3, tracks/skyroads/road7-1, tracks/skyroads/road7-2, tracks/skyroads/road7-3, tracks/skyroads/road8-1, tracks/skyroads/road8-2, tracks/skyroads/road8-3, tracks/skyroads/road9-1, tracks/skyroads/road9-2, tracks/skyroads/road9-3, tracks/skyroads/roada-1, tracks/skyroads/roada-2, tracks/skyroads/roada-3, tracks/bigtrack, tracks/easy_track, tracks/testtrack, tracks/track2, tracks/track3, tracks/track4, tracks/track5, tracks/track6, tracks/track7:
	modified tracks to use smaller images

	converted the 1024x1024 images to 512x512

2004-11-16  Christopher Schmidt  <crschmidt@crschmidt.net>

	* docs/ship_t:
	Start of work on some documentation work. I'd like to outline everything
	in this folder so that hackers don't have to dig through any kind of
	code in order to figure out what they need to know. Could also document
	track formats in here, etc., once we get that stuff together.

2004-11-10  Christopher Schmidt  <crschmidt@crschmidt.net>

	* tracks/skyroads/road4-2:
	Missed this one. I'm not sure this level is faithful to the original:
	seems to be missing some pieces that I thought were there. Then again,
	maybe my memory just sucks.

	* tracks/skyroads/road7-1, tracks/skyroads/road7-3, tracks/skyroads/road8-3, tracks/skyroads/roada-1, tracks/skyroads/roada-3:
	Gravity on these levels was too high for SDLRoads play. Updated to be more
	in line with the original game and to allow these levels to be beatable.
	The only level I haven't beat now is roada-3: everything else is tested and
	can be beaten (although many of them are pretty damn hard.)

	* tracks/skyroads/Makefile.am, tracks/skyroads/road1-1, tracks/skyroads/road1-2, tracks/skyroads/road1-3, tracks/skyroads/road2-1, tracks/skyroads/road2-2, tracks/skyroads/road2-3, tracks/skyroads/road3-1, tracks/skyroads/road3-2, tracks/skyroads/road3-3, tracks/skyroads/road4-1, tracks/skyroads/road4-2, tracks/skyroads/road4-3, tracks/skyroads/road5-1, tracks/skyroads/road5-2, tracks/skyroads/road5-3, tracks/skyroads/road6-1, tracks/skyroads/road6-2, tracks/skyroads/road6-3, tracks/skyroads/road7-1, tracks/skyroads/road7-2, tracks/skyroads/road7-3, tracks/skyroads/road8-1, tracks/skyroads/road8-2, tracks/skyroads/road8-3, tracks/skyroads/road9-1, tracks/skyroads/road9-2, tracks/skyroads/road9-3, tracks/skyroads/roada-1, tracks/skyroads/roada-2, tracks/skyroads/roada-3, tracks/skyroads/tracks.list, configure.ac, tracks/Makefile.am:
	Commiting a ton of track files. These are all 30 levels from the original
	Skyroads and a tracks.list to go with them. We will eventually make it easy
	to select these tracks as a levelset, but for right now, you just have to
	figure out how to load them on their own. Thanks to soup for the help getting
	these out of the original game! More info on that in the weblog. Thanks soup!

2004-10-22  Christopher Schmidt  <crschmidt@crschmidt.net>

	* INSTALL-OSX:
	OSX Specific Install instructions, including how to modify configure.ac and
	what to put into $LIBS in order to get things to compile using Fink packages

2004-10-21  Christopher Schmidt  <crschmidt@crschmidt.net>

	* src/menu.c:
	Make it so that menu items wrap. Mostly for the track code, and not
	really window-size dependant at the moment, but fixed the "Track listing
	goes off the screen" bug.

2004-10-21  Paul Guder  <enyalios@enyalios.net>

	* src/defs.h, src/main.c, src/render.c, src/ship.c, src/window.c:
	Cleaned up the win code a bit and added some nice text when you complete a level.

2004-10-21  Peter Newman  <panewman@uiuc.edu>

	* src/track.c:
	num_positions is now explicitly zeroed before being recounted to prevent tracks
	from getting longer and longer...

2004-10-21  Christopher Schmidt  <crschmidt@crschmidt.net>

	* configure.ac:
	Libpng isn't needed to play the game. We may want to generate a warning at
	some point, but we don't need a complete failure if it doesn't exist.

	* ChangeLog: Committing up to date ChangeLog

2004-10-21  Paul Guder  <enyalios@enyalios.net>

	* models/rapier.mtl, models/rapier.obj, models/rapier.wings:
	Edited ship model so it would make cooler explosions.

	* src/window.c: Added delay of 20 ms after rendering each frame.

	* src/input.c, src/render.c, src/window.c: Pause uses less cpu.

2004-10-21  Peter Newman  <panewman@uiuc.edu>

	* TODO: more TODO

	* src/main.c, src/menu.c, src/menu.h, src/render.c:

	* src/render.c: Made the pause screen prettier.

2004-10-21  Peter Newman  <panewman@uiuc.edu>

	* src/args.c, src/consts.h, src/defs.h, src/main.c, src/menu.c, src/scene.c, src/settings.c, src/ship.c, src/track.c, src/track.h, src/window.c, tracks/Makefile.am, tracks/tracks.list, NEWS, TODO:
	Play proceeds through levels listed in tracks/tracks.list.  Also, ship no longer
	resets when fullscreen is toggled.

	* src/defs.h, src/input.c, src/main.c, src/menu.c, src/render.c, src/scene.c, src/settings.c, src/window.c:
	Configuration file written on quit(0).  As a sidenote, quit now takes a
	condition code.

	* src/track.c: Fixed filename bug in track_load

2004-10-20  Peter Newman  <panewman@uiuc.edu>

	* NEWS, TODO: NEWS and TODO updated

	* src/settings.c: Check for win32 added before file check.

2004-10-20  Peter Newman  <panewman@uiuc.edu>

	* src/main.c, src/scene.c, src/util.c, src/window.c, NEWS, TODO, src/defs.h:
	render_init called when fullscreen is toggled.  didn't help all that much for
	win32

2004-10-20  Paul Guder  <enyalios@enyalios.net>

	* src/consts.h, src/settings.c:
	Changed the default tracking and music playing-ness.

2004-10-20  Peter Newman  <panewman@uiuc.edu>

	* src/args.c, src/args.h, src/camera.c, src/camera.h, src/core.h, src/defs.h, src/images.c, src/images.h, src/input.c, src/main.c, src/menu.c, src/model.c, src/model.h, src/render.c, src/render.h, src/scene.c, src/scene.h, src/settings.c, src/settings.h, src/ship.c, src/ship.h, src/sound.c, src/sound.h, src/text.c, src/text.h, src/track.c, src/track.h, src/util.c, src/window.c:
	Major reorganization of globals in the game.  There should be no more externs in
	c files.  Also fixed that annoying ``I can't see the track or my ship!'' bug.

	* src/menu.c: the volatiles in the free function weren't necessary

	* src/menu.c, src/menu.h: Fixed bugs in menu cleanup function.

	* src/consts.h, src/defs.h, src/input.c, src/menu.c, src/menu.h, src/util.c, src/util.h, src/window.c:
	Fullscreen toggling with 'f' added.  Also, there is a working option in the
	options menu for setting fullscreen.  For now, the setting will be the first
	character of the word fullscreen.

2004-10-19  Peter Newman  <panewman@uiuc.edu>

	* src/menu.c, src/menu.h:
	Menu system reorganized.  Now with void pointers(tm)!

	* src/ship.c:
	Outline is much closer to the ground now.  Witness the horror.

	* src/consts.h: Added some constants for use in the menu

2004-10-18  Peter Newman  <panewman@uiuc.edu>

	* src/settings.c, src/sound.c, src/track.c, ChangeLog, TODO, autogen.sh:
	Updated TODO and a few other changes made to source files a few days ago but
	couldn't commit.

2004-10-18  Christopher Schmidt  <crschmidt@crschmidt.net>

	* TODO: testing

	* README: Please please work.

2004-10-16  Peter Newman  <panewman@uiuc.edu>

	Sound is now an object(tm)!

2004-10-16  Christopher Schmidt  <crschmidt@crschmidt.net>

	* ChangeLog: This time, with ./mkchangelog!

	* ChangeLog: Adding a new changelog file

2004-10-13  Christopher Schmidt  <crschmidt@crschmidt.net>

	* src/window.c:
	When we're in a pause state, we're still constantly rendering. Although
	this is nice for our FPS rate, it's a big cyclesuck that we really don't
	need. Give up some timeslices to the processor, dropping CPU load on my
	machine from 100% (with no SDL_Delay) to 60% (with 10 timeslice delay)
	to 8% (with 100 timeslice delay). There is a barely noticible lag between
	pressing p and the actual unpause, but it's barely noticible, and not
	a hindrance on gameplay.

2004-10-10  Christopher Schmidt  <crschmidt@crschmidt.net>

	* src/menu.c:
	Although Linux doesn't seem to complain about it, defining a variable as
	'main' on OS X causes it to fail in compile:

	menu.c:30: error: `SDL_main' redeclared as different kind of symbol

	This fixes the problem, by changing "main" to "mainm", thus avoiding the
	conflict.

2004-10-07  Christopher Schmidt  <crschmidt@crschmidt.net>

	* src/menu.c:
	Changing menu.c to be a little bit easier to modify without causing a
	segfault. use an already existing variable to do some more work for us

2004-09-05  Peter Newman  <panewman@uiuc.edu>

	* src/consts.h, src/defs.h, src/main.c, src/menu.c, src/menu.h, src/settings.c, src/settings.h:
	Poking around with the menu implementation

2004-07-16  Peter Newman  <panewman@uiuc.edu>

	* src/args.h, src/camera.c, src/camera.h, src/consts-falcon.h, src/consts.h, src/defs.h, src/images.c, src/images.h, src/input.c, src/input.h, src/main.c, src/model.c, src/model.h, src/render.c, src/render.h, src/scene.c, src/scene.h, src/ship.c, src/ship.h, src/sound.c, src/sound.h, src/text.c, src/text.h, src/track.c, src/track.h, src/window.c, src/window.h, src/args.c:
	Added GPL notice to the source files

2004-05-28  Peter Newman  <panewman@uiuc.edu>

	* src/aircut3.ttf, src/ganymede.ttf, src/render.c, src/text.c, src/text.h:
	Some font alignment issues fixed.  At the moment, the screen should give a
	subtle reminder of the alphabet.

	* src/defs.h, src/images.h, src/model.h, src/orbit.ttf, src/render.c, src/ship.h, src/sound.h, src/text.c, src/text.h, src/track.h, src/window.c, src/args.h:
	Added a font and ran it across the screen.  Also, the progress and speed bars
	were made transparent.

2004-05-16  Paul Guder  <enyalios@enyalios.net>

	* config.log, config.status, configure.ac:
	Fixed bug in configure.ac.

2004-05-13  Christopher Schmidt  <crschmidt@crschmidt.net>

	* configure.ac:
	Apparently, we were checking for libraries... and silently failing if
	they didn't have them. That's great, for us, since we all have these
	libraries installed, but assuming that everyone has SDL_ttf is kinda
	dumb :P Set it so it will fail loudly, and not finish ./configure.

2004-05-12  Peter Newman  <panewman@uiuc.edu>

	* ChangeLog, NEWS, README, TODO: Updates to some project files.

	* src/consts.h, src/ship.c: One more head-on collision bug fixed.

	* src/window.h, src/camera.h, src/render.c, src/render.h, src/scene.c, src/ship.c, src/window.c:
	Explosion happens at slower speeds, newline removed from FPS output, as it was
	extraneous.

2004-05-11  Peter Newman  <panewman@uiuc.edu>

	* src/render.c, TODO: Wrote into the TODO.

2004-05-11  Christopher Schmidt  <crschmidt@crschmidt.net>

	* images/Makefile.am:
	Adding the rest of the images to the makefile.am, so we actually release
	all of them. Otherwise, you get a nice green screen of death in some
	situations where you're trying to load images you don't have.

	Also threw a new tarball on http://sdlroads.sf.net/ .

2004-05-11  Peter Newman  <panewman@uiuc.edu>

	* README, src/window.c:
	Added SDL_ANYFORMAT to window.c, for better compatibility with graphics modes
	other than my own.

	* autogen.sh, src/render.c:
	Autogen.sh needed some touching up.  Some other things too

	* src/render.c:
	Optimized the background rendering process using a display list.

	* src/Makefile.am, tracks/Makefile.am, sound/Makefile.am, config.log, config.status, configure.ac, images/Makefile.am, Makefile.am:
	Added more makefiles for smoother distribution.

	* src/consts.h, src/render.c, src/ship.c:
	2D effects drawn orthographically now.  Numerical hacks removed.  Drawmode
	switches optimized using display lists.

	* src/render.c, src/text.c, src/consts.h:
	2D HUD effects corrected.  Fadeout is a bit broken at the moment, though.

2004-05-10  Peter Newman  <panewman@uiuc.edu>

	* src/args.c, src/args.h, src/model.c:
	Minor updates all over; corrected some output strings in args.c

	* src/input.c, src/input.h, src/main.c, src/window.c, src/window.h, src/camera.c, config.log:
	Some spring cleaning; many unused variables and functions removed (i.e., mouse
	handlers).  Also moved the sound initializations out of main and into window, as
	requested by enyalios's comment in the older main.c

	* src/ship.c:
	Collision detection fixed.  Front-corner glitch fixed by re-prioritizing the
	collision checks.

	* TODO, config.log, config.status, configure.ac:
	configure.ac should be fixed now

	* src/consts.h, src/defs.h, src/render.c, src/ship.c, src/ship.h, src/text.c, src/text.h, src/track.c, src/Makefile.am:
	Fixed some of the files up a bit in CVS.  Should be compilable after a checkout
	now.  Also fixed some collision detection glitches.  Only one remains...

2004-05-10  Christopher Schmidt  <crschmidt@crschmidt.net>
